Our nick name ""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" was given to Marines in the 60's during the Vietnam Conflict by no other than the hippy commie loving liberals. The fact is we did get a little carried away with souvenirs in Vietnam, if you know what I mean lol. Marines being Marines took the name as a compliment because we are just as proud of our perfections as imperfections. The irony of our nickname and where it derived, and who gave it to us is the dark hidden humor we use on daily bases. Look around you, look at our country, and our current state of affairs. We are all Uncle Sam's Children, some of us are Misguided, some of us are Mislead, and some of us are just Mischievous, but we are all children of Uncle Sam's. AMERICA!
